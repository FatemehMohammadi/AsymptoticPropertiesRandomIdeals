# Asymptotic Properties of Random Monomial Ideals

This repository contains code supporting the computational experiments in the project *Asymptotic properties of random monomial ideals* by  Fatemeh Mohammadi, Sonja Petrović, Eduardo Sáenz-de-Cabezón (2026). 

The code implements simulations and measurements related to **random (squarefree) monomial ideals**, with emphasis on:

- LCM-lattices and **LCM-lattice (poset) density**
- Random graph and hypergraph models via monomial ideals
- Empirical evidence for **phase transition behavior**
- Relationships between generator density and algebraic redundancy
